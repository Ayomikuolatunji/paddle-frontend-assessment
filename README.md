**Libraries and dependecies you used in implementing the application**

1, Axios: I make use axios to make http request that fetch the github profiles data. Axios site to know more https://axios-http.com/docs/intro

2, React Icons: All the icons I use throughout the building process comes from that package.React icons main website https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/

3, Ant Design: Antd provide reuseable component such as button, input text, textarea, .etc. See more about antd https://ant.design/

4, Tailwindcss: The entire app was styled with tailwindcss(A utility-first CSS framework). Visit tailwindcss site to see more https://tailwindcss.com/

5, Redux Toolkit: Data state management was implemented with redux toolkit which helps us to handle data fetching and then dispatch it to the part of the app that needs it without writing multiple react hook. It also helps to avoid prop drilling when passing data from one component to another. You can see more about redux https://redux-toolkit.js.org/
